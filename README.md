Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is committed to train future drivers through convenient driving lessions and content. The client is the owner of the DriverPass system who wants the system to be a safe with excellent security measures. The owner also wants the system to record everything modified or updated for personal records and for the system to have access to the cloud so that the DriverPass system does not have any change of data leaks or problems. 

What did you do particularly well?

I designed the system pretty well by following the guidelines and the wants of the owner and I also illustrated this with different diagrams that highlight my work. I also created a software design document that lays out the background of the DriverPass system that gives better insight of what the owner wants. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would love to revise my UML diagrams, specifically my UML class diagram so that I could improve and enhance my use cases and how they interact with each other with their corresponding actors. I would love to give my UML class diagram unique additions that would give the DriverPass system a portrayal of a deeper understanding. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Implementing the user's needs allowed me to design a system that catered to specifics such as allowing the user to create unique login information or granting them extra assistance in case they need help create appointments for their lessions using the DriverPass system. It is important considering the user's needs when designing a system because it gives the user a sense of appreciation and it would entice the user to use the system since it is pertains to their needs. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software with a plan that allows me to complete seperate tasks that completes a total goal. In the future I will use planning strategies such as designing a Ganatt chart if I am to ever work with a team. I will also utilize the diagrams such as the UML class diagram as well as a couple of activity diagrams that highlight important aspects of a project so that it is easier to understand later on.
